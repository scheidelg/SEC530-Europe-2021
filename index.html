<!-- Redirect to the OneNote notebook for this class.

     The class will have an 'edit' link through which the class can access the
     notebook for editing.  This page will, when first set up, redirect to
     that edit link.

     The edit link will typically have an expiration date, after which the
     class will need to use a 'view' link.  This page's JavaScript code will
     start redirecting to the view link one day before the edit link's
     expiration date.

     To account for the possibility that the JavaScript doesn't work for a
     client, an HTTP redirect is also used in the HTML header.  Similarly,
     the HTML body includes a message identifying the redirect target.

     If the 'edit' link does have an expiration date, then remember to come
     back just ahead of the expiration date and update the hard-coded HTTP
     redirect to use the view link.  Again, just to account for the
     possibility that the JavaScript doesn't work for a client.
